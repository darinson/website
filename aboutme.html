            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Darin Son, or 손다린 in Korean.<br>
                I grew up in Seoul, Korea for 18 years.<br>
                My family moved to Irvine, California in 2015, where I live now.<br>
                I attended Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo for college between 2015~2020.<br>
                I have a bachelor's and a master's degree in Environmental Engineering.<br>
                In my free time, I like to cook, admire plants, jog, yoga and watch movies! I'm not very good at it, but
                I do like surfing and longboarding around my neighborhood also :)
