            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Darin Son, or 손다린 in Korean.<br>
                I grew up in Seoul, Korea for 18 years.<br>
                My family moved to Irvine, California in 2015, where I live now.<br>
                I attended Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo for college between 2015~2020.<br>
                I have a bachelor's and a master's degree in Environmental Engineering.<br>
                It was through my master's thesis where I worked with data and
                realized I like working with the computer!<br>
                I hope to make sustainability more accessible for people and organizations.<br>
