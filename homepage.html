            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>My name is Darin Son, or 손다린 in Korean.<br>
                I grew up in Seoul, Korea for 18 years.<br>
                My family moved to Irvine, California in 2015, where I live now.<br>
                I attended Cal Poly, San Luis Obispo for college between 2015~2020.<br>
                I have a bachelor's and a master's degree in Environmental Engineering.<br>
                In my free time, I like to cook, admire plants, jog, yoga and watch movies! I'm not very good at it, but
                I do like surfing and longboarding around my neighborhood also :)

            <h1>My Coding/Data Science Background</h1>
            <p>For my master's degree, I did research on biological treatment methods for dairy wastewater. You can read
                more about that adventure <a href="https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/theses/2222/">here</a>!<br>
                It was through my master's thesis where I got more comfortable around working with data and that maybe
                field work wasn't for me.<br>
                Combined with my previous experience in establishing a website for my high school newspaper and
                creating utility dashboards for Cal Poly's Facilities department, my curiosity for web development and
                data science is ready to learn more! <br>
                Through this coding bootcamp, I hope to gain the technical skills that can help me build my own
                portfolio, where I can showcase myself and my work in data!
                In the long run, I hope to make sustainability more accessible for organizations that impact people's
                lives.<br>
