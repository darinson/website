            <h1>Cal Poly</h1>
            <p>For my master's degree, I did research on biological treatment methods for dairy wastewater. You can read
                more about that adventure <a href="https://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/theses/2222/">here</a>!<br>
                It was through my master's thesis where I got more comfortable around working with data and that maybe
                field work wasn't for me.<br>
